# RickAndMorty
Application created for job interview purposes

The application was built entirely in SwiftUI without using 3rd party libraries. The main goal was to show the potential of SwiftUI.

For application purposes I've fetched data from Rick and Morty API, but only from the first page of the Characters and Episodes endpoint. 

I was planning to implement additional features/improvements:
- making the search bar work and filter the given episodes or characters
- fully implement navigation based on enums and utilizing NavigationStack(path)
- implement a custom loader
- implement async/await where possible
- improve Unit Test code coverage
- correct UI issues
- implement .light mode, not the app works mostly in dark mode
- separate episodes and characters into two different view models
- other ... I haven't thought about
